## TODO

### Fixups

- Don't show unplanned empty meals on non-edit views
- Add similar css to "left" tooltip when it would be below screen

### Meals

If I can do this the most low-effort way possible, it could be really helpful for making
building new menus much easier.

Taxonomy:

- **ingredient**: item with specific calories (e.g., chicken breast)

- **dish**: produced from one recipe (e.g., chicken pita wrap); can use other dishes if
  necessary (e.g., chicken pita wraps that use chicken marinade)

- **meal**: set of dishes that reach a specific calorie goal (e.g., chicken pita wrap +
  baked Brussels sprouts). (Currently, tied to: all food eaten at a time on a day.)

The gap has been that I plan in terms of meals, but constantly need to compose dishes
into meals.

Master plan:
- make the week edit window display meals as a primary view, and dishes either below or
  as a separate view.

Thought: I could sort combos by meal and then by calorie ranges. E.g., have a ~500 +/-
50 cals region. Could stratify by 100s or by 50s

- by 100s: 450 -- 549 ~= 500
- by 50s: 475 -- 524 ~= 500

### Meal prep checklist

Allow this to be set

### Ingredient shopping prefixes

## Notes

### Why menus?

Doing a full week of meal planning takes a long time because of trying to
- re-use ingredients throughout the week
- account for ingredients I already have
- account for packaging (e.g., 1 lb beef, 2 chicken breasts, loaf of bread, 6-pack buns)
- account for timing (climbing mornings w/o cook time, leftover save lengths)
- account for saving (meats, many vegetables, and premade salads don't last the week if
  bought on saturday beforehand)

Plus, you can try more time saving strategies:
- cooking in bulk so I'm not cooking dinner from scratch every day (e.g., stew)
- having to-go or premade breakfasts or lunches (or both), so I don't have to prep both

Overall, I'd like to keep meals healthy and cheap, but I don't want to spend a ton of
time cooking all 3 meals per day. I'd rather have some repeats _and then spend longer on
one weeknight or a weekend cooking a new and interesting recipe_.

It can be useful to try to pre-design some week plans ahead of time around themes
(e.g., mexican, asian, american, etc.) to encourage ingredient reuse, and take into
account ingredient quantities, some bulk prep, and faster breakfasts or lunches. Can
also plan in 1â€“2 new meals to try. **Helpful to do this on paper / text form to figure
out the high level plan, and then work out the actual recipes, ingredients, and calories
later.** I think figuring out both the high level and low level plans at the same time
is what makes this exhausting, and makes being creative difficult.

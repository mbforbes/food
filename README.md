Calorie consolidation

## Note

I think at this point thinking through time saving measures would be a good idea.

Doing a full week of meal planning takes a long time because of trying to
- re-use ingredients throughout the week
- account for ingredients I already have
- account for packaging (e.g., 1 lb beef, 2 chicken breasts, loaf of bread, 6-pack buns)
- account for timing (climbing mornings w/o cook time, leftover save lengths)
- account for saving (meats, many vegetables, and premade salads don't last the week if
  bought on saturday beforehand)

Plus, I'd like to try a bit more of time saving strategies:
- cooking in bulk so I'm not cooking dinner from scratch every day (e.g., stew)
- having to-go or premade breakfasts or lunches (or both), so I don't have to prep both

Overall, I'd like to keep meals healthy and cheap, but I don't want to spend a ton of
time cooking all 3 meals per day. I'd rather have some repeats _and then spend longer on
one weeknight or a weekend cooking a new and interesting recipe_.

It could be useful to try to pre-design some week plans ahead of time around themes
(e.g., mexican, asian, american, etc.) to encourage ingredient reuse, and take into
account ingredient quantities, some bulk prep, and faster breakfasts or lunches. Can
also plan in 1–2 new meals to try. **Could even do this on paper / text form to figure
out the high level plan, and then work out the actual recipes, ingredients, and calories
later.** I think figuring out both the high level and low level plans at the same time
is what makes this exhausting, and makes being creative difficult.

## TODO

- [ ] **It's too hard to add dishes.** With a decent idea of what's healthy, it
  should be easier to add dishes for quick planning purposes without computing
  exact quantities and calories. We can then add measurements down the road.
  
- [ ] **Better dishes view**. A single super long scroll is bad. A grid + pictures
  would be nice.
  
- [ ] **UI Buttons**. To easily switch between views.

- [ ] **(Optional) pictures in dishes view.**

- [ ] **Better code organization.** It's getting gross.
